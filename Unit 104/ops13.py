# Today in Class we are building the childhood game Rock Paper Scissors
# We are going to import the random function for our code today
# Bonus objective can you put it on a while loop to play again
# Do not just google the game and copy paste, If you would like to look at a completed version if you get stuck on a step please do so.
#Write your code below this line:
